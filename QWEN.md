# Stella - Project Context

## Project Overview
This is a personal learning project designed to push your web development skills to the limit and serve as both a practical tool and a lead generation mechanism for custom web development services. The goal is to create Stella, a lightweight tool for building customized landing pages with pre-built templates that users can customize and export as static HTML/CSS/JS bundles.

## Current State
The repository currently contains only a README.md file describing the project concept and planned features. The actual implementation is pending and will serve as your learning journey.

## Project Goals (Learning Focused)
- **Skill Development**: Push your web development knowledge by implementing complex features
- **Technology Mastery**: Deepen understanding of vanilla JavaScript, Supabase, and Node.js
- **Best Practices**: Implement responsive, user-friendly interfaces following modern standards
- **Full-Stack Development**: Learn to handle both frontend and backend aspects
- **Real-World Application**: Build a tool that solves a practical problem

## Key Features (Planned)
1. **Template Selection**: Choose from modern, responsive templates
2. **Customization Interface**: Edit headlines, colors, and upload images with live preview
3. **Static Export**: Download HTML/CSS/JS bundles with hosting guide
4. **Showcase Gallery**: View examples to inspire projects
5. **Analytics**: Private tracking of user activity for lead identification

## Technical Stack (Learning Focused)
- **Frontend**: Vanilla JavaScript for live previews and form handling (challenge yourself without frameworks)
- **Styling**: CSS Grid/Flexbox for responsive layouts (master responsive design patterns)
- **Backend**: Supabase for auth, template storage, and image uploads (learn modern backend-as-a-service)
- **Server**: Node.js/Express for ZIP generation and analytics API (deepen backend knowledge)
- **Export**: JSZip for creating downloadable bundles (learn file manipulation)
- **Deployment**: Render or Vercel for hosting (understand modern deployment strategies)

## Learning Objectives
- Challenge yourself with complex JavaScript DOM manipulation for the live preview
- Understand how to structure maintainable vanilla JavaScript without frameworks
- Master CSS architecture patterns for scalable styling
- Learn Supabase integration deeply (authentication, storage, real-time features)
- Explore Node.js backend architecture and API design
- Implement advanced JavaScript patterns for state management
- Understand the entire web development lifecycle from development to deployment

## Development Approach
This project should be approached as a learning challenge where you implement each feature without seeking direct solutions. When facing problems:
- Research concepts independently before implementing
- Experiment with different approaches to understand trade-offs
- Debug issues step-by-step to strengthen problem-solving skills
- Refactor code regularly to improve architecture and maintainability
- Document your learning process and decisions

## Implementation Guidance
Instead of providing direct solutions, focus on these learning directions:
- **For live preview functionality**: Research JavaScript DOM manipulation and CSS variable updates
- **For template management**: Explore data structures and state management in JavaScript
- **For ZIP export**: Investigate JSZip library and file blob creation
- **For user authentication**: Study Supabase documentation and authentication flows
- **For responsive design**: Practice mobile-first approach and media queries
- **For form handling**: Implement validation and user feedback mechanisms

Remember, the goal is to grow your skills by working through challenges independently rather than seeking quick solutions. The process of solving problems will make you a better developer.

## Recommended Learning Path
1. Start with basic HTML/CSS structure for the UI
2. Add vanilla JavaScript functionality incrementally
3. Integrate Supabase for data persistence later in development
4. Implement ZIP export functionality after core features work
5. Polish the UI/UX based on user testing and feedback
